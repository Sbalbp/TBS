##Cloning with NetBeans

This software is being developed with the NetBeans IDE and its GIT plugin, so it is possible to clone the project to a local folder using this same IDE. Keep in mind, though, that you need the NetBeans GIT plugin installed in order to make this work.

To clone the project with the NetBeans GIT plugin, follow these steps:

* **1.** Open NetBeans and go to 'Team -> Git -> Clone'.
* **2.** Fill the 'Repository URL' form with **https://github.com/Sbalbp/TBS.git** and then your username and password for github. After that, press the 'Next' button.
* **3.** Select the branch to clone (for now, master) and press the 'Next' button.
* **4.** Fill the 'Parent Directory' form with the folder where you want to store the clone and select a name for it (make sure you don't have any project with that name). You can also select a name for your remote here. When you are done press the 'Finish' button.
* **5.** NetBeans will now ask you whether you want to open the project or not. You can open it later ('File -> Open Project') selecting the folder where you cloned it.
* **6.** Lastly, make sure to build the project once you have opened it.
